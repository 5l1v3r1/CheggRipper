# CheggRipper
This script gets the Chegg solutions for any given textbook and outputs all of them to a simple html document. 
It is intended to be automatic, once I get it to work that way but for now you can:

Find a textbook you want all the solutions for and navigate to the first question in the first chapter.
In chrome console, copy/paste the two functions at the top and enter them into the console.
Then follow the directions in the script.
